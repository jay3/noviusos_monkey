Monkey
======

An application sample for Novius OS
http://www.novius-os.org

**Requirements**

Have a Novius OS instance up to date on rel branch.

**Get started**

* Open a shell.
* Go to local/applications.
* git clone git://github.com/novius-os/noviusos_monkey.git. This creates a noviusos_monkey directory.
* Execute the MySQL script noviusos_monkey/create_tables.sql in your Novius OS database. You get two new tables (nos_monkey and nos_monkey_species).
* Open Novius OS back-office in your browser.
* Go to the "Applications manager" tab (in the top-right corner) and install Monkey.
* That's it, now play around with it and modify it!
